# Impact on Information Resources

## data resources

The CAP LTER added 11 new datasets to its publicly available data holdings during the reporting year. These new additions bring the total number of project datasets archived with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) to 234. New datasets of note include (1) a long-term (2010-current) record of reptiles and arthropods collected near an Arizona State University satellite campus in Mesa, Arizona that is part of a survey methods course taught by a CAP LTER team leader (H. Bateman), and (2) a dataset of spatial resources that document Urban Ecological Infrastructure (UEI) features in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area and surrounding Sonoran desert. In addition to the 11 new datasets added, 7 existing datasets featuring CAP LTER long-term monitoring and experiment data were updated with new information and metadata. All CAP LTER dataset metadata are encoded in the XML-based Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema, with data and metadata available through the CAP LTER data catalog on the project website, the EDI data portal, and DataONE.

## infrastructure

The CAP LTER Information Manager strives always to improve the presentation, utility, and management of CAP LTER information resources. Notable improvements for this reporting year include:

- A new virtual machine hosted by Arizona State University to support web-based applications that enable CAP LTER research technicians to enter, upload, and view long-term monitoring data.
- Continued improvement of a suite of R-based tools that aid the development of EML metadata used to describe research data. Though developed by and for the CAP LTER, these tools are generalizable and publicly available.

## Network participation
 
The CAP LTER is committed to making a strong contribution to informatics within the LTER Network and the ecological sciences generally. The CAP LTER Information Manager (S. Earl) participates in all network information meetings and activities, serves as co-chair of the LTER Information Management Executive Committee (IM Exec), participates in and presents at numerous scientific conferences, and contributes to scientific- and informatics-focused publications. In addition, though past its official end date, S. Earl remains actively involved in the continued workings of a LTER Synthesis Working Group addressing soil organic matter dynamics, and several spin-off projects that include (1) an effort to develop best practices for managing soil-centric data, and (2) an Earth Science Information Partnership (ESIP) working group focused connecting the soils research community and those whose research incorporates soils data to informatics tools for better research.
