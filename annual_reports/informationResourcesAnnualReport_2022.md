# Impact on Information Resources

## data resources

The CAP LTER added 7 new or revised datasets to its publicly available data holdings during the reporting year. These new additions bring the total number of project datasets archived with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) to 254 as of this writing. New or updates to existing datasets of note include (1) several datasets that reflect CAP's growing number of projects that employ camera-trapping techniques to study patterns and processes of urban megafauna, and (2) a revamped and greatly improved presentation of CAP's long-term monitoring of atmospheric deposition data. All CAP LTER dataset metadata are encoded in the XML-based Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema, with data and metadata available through the CAP LTER data catalog on the project website, the EDI data portal, and DataONE.

## infrastructure

The CAP LTER Information Manager strives always to improve the presentation, utility, and management of CAP LTER information resources. Notable improvements for this reporting period include:

- A combination of new and updated field- (tablets) and web-based data-entry applications that improve the accuracy and efficiency of data acquisition by CAP LTER field and lab technicians.
- Continued improvement of a suite of R-based tools that aid the development of EML metadata used to describe research data. In particular, many new features capitalize on the growing number of API services offered by the EDI. Though developed by and for the CAP LTER, these tools are generalizable and publicly available.

## Network participation
 
The CAP LTER is committed to making a strong contribution to informatics within the LTER Network and the ecological sciences generally. The CAP LTER Information Manager (S. Earl) participates in all Network information management meetings and activities, participates in and presents at numerous scientific conferences, and contributes to scientific- and informatics-focused publications. This year, S. Earl rotated off the LTER Information Management Committee (IMC) Executive Committee after having served a five-year term, the last three as Co-Chair. S. Earl is a contributor to numerous working groups, including teams focused on (1) improving metadata describing units of measure, (2) assessing the impacts of wildfire on the biogeochemistry of flowing waters in aridlands, (3) developing ontologies to improve the discoverability and interoperability of data pertaining to soils, and (4) developing resources to teach sound and effective data-management skills to students at Arizona State University, including those participating in the CAP LTER program.
