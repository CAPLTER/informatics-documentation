# Impact on Information Resources

## data resources

The CAP LTER added 15 new or revised datasets to its publicly available data holdings during the reporting year. The new additions bring the total number of project datasets archived with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) to 261 as of this writing. New or updates-to-existing datasets of note include: (1) expanding the temporal extent of time-series geospatial data, including Landsat-derived Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), and Soil Adjusted and Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices (SAVI and NDVI, respectively), and (2) high-frequency measurements of water quality and chlorophyll in the Tempe Town Lake (Tempe, Arizona, USA), a novel aquatic ecosystem optimal for studying dynamics among management decisions, environmental conditions, and limnological steady states. All CAP LTER dataset metadata are encoded in the XML-based Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema, with data and metadata available through the CAP LTER data catalog on the project website, the EDI data portal, and DataONE.

## infrastructure

The CAP LTER Information Manager strives always to improve the presentation, utility, and management of CAP LTER information resources. Notable improvements for this reporting period include:

- Further expansion and refinement of tablet-based data-entry applications that improve the accuracy and efficiency of data acquisition by CAP LTER technicians.
- Continued improvement of a suite of R-based tools that aid the development of EML metadata used to describe research data. In particular, the expanded use of configuration (yaml) files that simultaneously increases the readability of inputs while reducing the amount of R coding required to generate data packages. Though developed by and for the CAP LTER, these tools are generalizable and publicly available.
- Refactored database and data-entry application to support the CAP LTER's long-running monitoring of arthropods in the study area. The new system improves the accuracy and efficiency of data processing and storage, and integrates an updated taxonomy that aligns with community taxonomic resources, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). 

## Network participation
 
The CAP LTER is committed to making a strong contribution to informatics within the LTER Network and the ecological sciences generally. The CAP LTER Information Manager (S. Earl) participates in all Network information management meetings and activities, participates in numerous informatics and scientific conferences, and contributes to publications spanning both the ecological and informatics sciences. S. Earl is a contributor to numerous working groups, including: (1) a joint effort by the LTER and EDI to improve tools and resources to characterize units of measure, (2) a LTREB and NCEAS synthesis working group exploring the impacts of wildfire on the biogeochemistry of flowing waters in the arid Southwest, and (3) developing ontologies and other resources to improve the discoverability and interoperability of soil chemistry data.
