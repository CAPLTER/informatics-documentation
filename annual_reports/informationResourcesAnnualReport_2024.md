# Impact on Information Resources

## data resources

The CAP LTER added fourteen new or revised datasets to its publicly available data holdings during the reporting period, bringing the total number of CAP LTER data packages archived in the Environmental Data Initiative data repository to 268. Notable additions include updates to many of the CAP LTER's long-term monitoring programs, and new geospatial, time series documenting important geophysical properties, such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), throughout the study area. All CAP LTER dataset metadata are encoded in the XML-based Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema, with data and metadata available through the CAP LTER data catalog on the project website, the EDI data portal, and DataONE.

## infrastructure

The CAP LTER Information Manager strives always to improve the presentation, utility, and management of CAP LTER information resources. Notable improvements for this reporting period include:

- A refreshed CAP LTER website that provides a more seamless, streamlined experience to locate project information and resources.
- A new data-reporting template and instruction suite to make it easier and more intuitive for investigators to submit data and metadata for publication.
- Continued improvement of a suite of R-based tools that aid the development of EML metadata used to describe research data. In particular, new and updated features that support documenting geospatial (vector, raster) data products were added. Though developed by and for the CAP LTER, these tools are generalizable and publicly available.

## Network participation
 
The CAP LTER is committed to making a strong contribution to informatics within the LTER Network and the ecological sciences generally. The CAP LTER Information Manager (S. Earl) participates in all Network information management meetings and activities, participates in numerous informatics and scientific conferences, and contributes to publications spanning both the ecological and informatics sciences. S. Earl is a contributor to numerous working groups, including: (1) a joint effort by the LTER and EDI to improve tools and resources to characterize units of measure, (2) a LTREB and NCEAS synthesis working group exploring the impacts of wildfire on the biogeochemistry of flowing waters in the arid Southwest, and (3) developing ontologies and other resources to improve the discoverability and interoperability of soil chemistry data.
