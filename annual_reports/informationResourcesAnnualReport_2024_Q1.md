# Impact on Information Resources

## data resources

The CAP LTER added a revised dataset to its publicly available data holdings during the measurement period. The updated dataset includes the latest observations from the CAP LTER's long-running work exploring the dynamics among elevated nutrient inputs, notably via atmospheric deposition, and Sonoran desert ecosystem structure and function. The CAP LTER has archived 261 project datasets with the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) as of this writing. All CAP LTER dataset metadata are encoded in the XML-based Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema, with data and metadata available through the CAP LTER data catalog on the project website, the EDI data portal, and DataONE.

## infrastructure

The CAP LTER Information Manager strives always to improve the presentation, utility, and management of CAP LTER information resources. Notable improvements for this reporting period include:

- Further expansion and refinement of tablet-based data-entry applications that improve the accuracy and efficiency of data acquisition by CAP LTER technicians.
- Continued improvement of a suite of R-based tools that aid the development of EML metadata used to describe research data. In particular, the (1) expanded use of configuration (yaml) files that simultaneously increases the readability of inputs while reducing the amount of R coding required to generate data packages, (2) integration with the [QUDT](https://www.qudt.org/) semantic resource for units, and (3) option to include semantic annotations to selected metadata features to improve dataset interoperability. Though developed by and for the CAP LTER, these tools are generalizable and publicly available.

## Network participation
 
The CAP LTER is committed to making a strong contribution to informatics within the LTER Network and the ecological sciences generally. The CAP LTER Information Manager (S. Earl) participates in all Network information management meetings and activities, participates in numerous informatics and scientific conferences, and contributes to publications spanning both the ecological and informatics sciences. S. Earl is a contributor to numerous working groups, including: (1) a joint effort by the LTER and EDI to improve tools and resources to characterize units of measure, (2) a LTREB and NCEAS synthesis working group exploring the impacts of wildfire on the biogeochemistry of flowing waters in the arid Southwest, and (3) developing ontologies and other resources to improve the discoverability and interoperability of soil chemistry data.
