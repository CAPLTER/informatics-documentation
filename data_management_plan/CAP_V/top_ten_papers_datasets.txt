Andrade, R., J. Franklin, K.L. Larson, C.M. Swan, S.B. Lerman, H.L. Bateman, P.S. Warren and A. York. 2020. Predicting the assembly of novel communities in urban ecosystems. Landscape Ecology. DOI: 10.1007/s10980-020-01142-1. This collaboration with colleagues from the BES LTER program used a metacommunity perspective to address how human activities influence the processes by which ecological communities are structured in urban ecosystems. The authors presented a framework that links social-ecological dynamics to ecological communities in order to understand multi-scalar biodiversity patterns and the assembly of novel communities in urban ecosystems. The first author was a CAP graduate student.

Banville, M.J., H.L. Bateman, S.R. Earl and P.S. Warren. 2017. Decadal declines in bird abundance and diversity in urban riparian zones. Landscape and Urban Planning. DOI: 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.09.026. This paper used CAP’s long-term bird community data to examine long-term changes in bird assemblages at 12 riparian sites in Phoenix and the nearby Sonoran Desert. Engineered riparian sites supported more broadly distributed generalists while non-urban riparian sites supported more specialists. The authors found that bird species richness, diversity, and abundance declined across riparian types during the last two decades, even for common species. The first author was a member of the CAP staff.

Brown, J.A., K.L. Larson, S.B. Lerman, D.L. Childers, R. Andrade, H.L. Bateman, S.J. Hall, P.S. Warren, and A.M. York. 2020. Influences of environmental and social factors on perceived bio-cultural services and disservices. Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. DOI: 10.3389/fevo.2020.569730. This paper used CAP’s long-term social survey data to investigate residents’ perceptions of the coupled value of aesthetic and biological qualities as related to diverse UEI and other environmental and social factors. The results demonstrated the influence of place identity, neighborhood cohesion, and income on both biocultural services and disservices and underscored the added value of considering both the form of UEI and perceptions among people who live near it when designing and implementing infrastructure. Fig. 2.2 is from this publication. The first author was a CAP postdoc.

Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene. DOI: 10.1525/elementa.385. This paper presented the concept of UEI as broadly inclusive of all nature in cities. It discussed why the UEI concept is more useful than other similar terms, such as green infrastructure or nature-based solutions. It presented several demonstrative case studies, including two from CAP, as well as the UEI hybridity gradient shown in Fig. 1.2.

Rosi-Marshall and B.L. Ruddell. 2016. Moving towards a new urban systems science. Ecosystems. DOI: 10.1007/s10021-016-0053-4. This theoretical paper was produced by a number of well- respected urban ecologists. It presented two critical challenges for ecosystem science that are rooted in urban ecosystems: 1) predicting or explaining the assembly and function of novel communities and ecosystems in cities; and 2) refining our understanding of humans as components of ecosystems. The authors argued that addressing these challenges is critical to the further development of sustainability science. They pointed to the need for a new initiative in urban systems science to catalyze the next wave of fundamental advances in ecosystem science and interdisciplinary science.

Landscape and Urban Planning. DOI: 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.103744. This paper presented findings from CAP’s scenarios and futures work that used an approach focused on the co-development of positive and long-term alternative future visions. Through practitioner and academic stakeholder collaborations, this research integrated participatory scenario development, modeling, and qualitative scenario assessments. This work creates opportunities to bridge science and policy by building anticipatory and systems-based decision-making and research capacity for long-term sustainability planning.

Subjective evaluations of ecosystem services and disservices: an approach to creating and analyzing robust survey scales. Ecology and Society. DOI: 10.5751/ES10888-240207. This paper focused on public perceptions of ES/EDS, noting that ecosystem properties and functions can produce beneficial or detrimental outcomes for human wellbeing. It used a robust approach to measure beliefs about ecosystem services and disservices using CAP’s long-term social survey data. The analysis found distinctive patterns in resident views of desirable and undesirable biota, benefits and risks pertaining to heat and stormwater, recreational and aesthetic value, and societal nuisances and problems.

This analysis used a key long-term CAP dataset to explore how The Great Recession affected the dynamics of residential vegetation diversity. The authors found that the housing market boom–bust episode acted as a socioeconomic driver of overall plant community composition. Many neighborhoods in Phoenix were hit hard by foreclosures and home abandonment. Once lawn management stopped, the plant communities reverted to a more “weedy” composition. The first author was a CAP graduate student.

Water and nitrogen shape winter annual plant diversity and community composition in near-urban Sonoran Desert preserves. Ecological Monographs. DOI: 10.1002/ecm.1450. This paper used data from CAP’s long-term N and P fertilization experiment in urban and Sonoran Desert parks and preserves to test how nutrient availability interacts with growing season precipitation, urban location, and microhabitat to affect winter annual plant diversity. The analysis found reduced taxonomic diversity of annual plants in N-enriched and urban plots and that water availability in both current and previous growing seasons was a primary control on annual plant diversity. Fig. 2.3 is from this publication and the first author was a CAP graduate student.
